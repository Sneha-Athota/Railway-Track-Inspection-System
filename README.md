# Railway Track Inspection System

This project was developed as part of our Senior Design Project. It’s a web-based railway track inspection system built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Python. The system aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of railway infrastructure by enabling remote monitoring and automated analysis of track conditions. It provides a user-friendly interface for operators to view inspection data, detect anomalies, and manage reports.

# Overview
The system uses a combination of drone data collection, machine learning-based fault detection, and cloud integration to automatically identify defects in railway tracks.
Key features include:
- Uploading and viewing inspection images/videos
- Automatic defect detection and report generation
- Web interface for easy access by railway operators

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Machine Learning: Python (for the deep learning defect detection model)
- Database: MongoDB
